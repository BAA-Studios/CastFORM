**CastFORM** is an easy-to-use Pokémon TCG Deck Registration Sheet generator.  
**CastFORM** offers an elegant graphical interface for filling in Pokémon deck lists for tournaments, and creates beautiful PDFs from user input.

This project is based on [Brandon Nguyen's](https://github.com/Bratah123) CLI Python script that served a similar purpose. **CastFORM** was spearheaded in response to the high demand for a user-friendly program in his local TCG community, most of whom were not comfortable with CLI tools.

## Technical Information
**CastFORM** is built with **Flutter 3.7.8** for **Windows 11**, and targets [**Google's Dart style guide**](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style).  
For testing, we aim to provide complete coverage for API behaviour internally by release.
